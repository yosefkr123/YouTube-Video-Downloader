# YouTube-Video-Downloader
This Python program is designed to download videos from YouTube. Users are prompted to input a YouTube video URL, and the program checks the URL's validity. Next, it retrieves a list of available video resolutions, asks the user to choose a preferred resolution, and then proceeds to download the video in the selected resolution. The program handles potential errors that might occur during this process, such as invalid URLs or unavailable videos. The downloaded content is stored in the current working directory with a filename that incorporates the video's title and resolution. This program offers users flexibility in downloading videos according to their resolution preferences.
